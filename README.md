# Phishing-Website-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Models
This project focuses on multiple ML algorithms for identifying websites that are phished, are compared and analysed. Ada-Boost, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and KNN are among the machine learning techniques investigated.
